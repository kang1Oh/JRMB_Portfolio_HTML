                <h1>Hi, I'm Jane.</h1>
                <p>I'm passionate about a lot of things - from art and music to games and movies. 
                    <br>
                    <br> My journey began back in 2018 when I started sharing my work online. Over time, I've had some success as an indie artist, which has been incredibly fulfilling.
                    <br>
                    <br>My love for animation, nurtured since childhood, led me to pursue ICT in senior high school, primarily because it offered courses in animation. Little did I know that this decision would open doors to the world of programming, which quickly became a new passion of mine. It's amazing how one interest can drastically change one's career path.
                    <br>
                    <br>Nowadays, I'm focused on honing my programming skills, with Java being my primary language of expertise. However, I'm also diving into HTML and CSS, eager to expand my knowledge and skill set. Looking ahead, I dream of becoming an indie game developer or working in a game studio (Ubisoft Philippines, wait for me!), perhaps even overseas in Japan, the US, Canada, or elsewhere.
                    <br>
                    <br>The future holds exciting possibilities, and I can't wait to see where this journey takes me. Currently, I'm gearing up to delve into C++, a crucial step towards realizing my game development projects.
